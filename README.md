## Installation

To use these Python scripts, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your computer. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

You may also need to install additional libraries or modules depending on the script you want to use. These requirements will be listed in the README file of each script.

## Usage

Each script in this repository is standalone and can be run using the command line or an IDE such as PyCharm or Visual Studio Code.

To run a script, simply navigate to the directory where the script is located and type the following command in the terminal:

```
python scriptname.py
```


Replace `scriptname.py` with the name of the script you want to run.
